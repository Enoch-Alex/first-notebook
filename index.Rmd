# 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility
## Monya Baker
## 25 May 2016

</br>  

## Survey shed light on the 'crisis' rocking research. 
#### **More than 70% of researchers have and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments,** and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature's* survey of 1'576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.

</br> 

### The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant ‘crisis’ of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

## The Survey
</br>

### In the survey [^1] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

</br> 

* Better understanding of statistics
* Better mentoring/supervision
* More robust design
* Better teaching
* More within-lab validation
* Incentives for better practice
* Incentives for formal reproduction
* More external-lab validation
* More time for mentoring
* Journals enforcing standards
* More time checking notebooks
